# WeeklySprints

Repo of projects I made each week, or at least trying to do so.

Idea is that every week at least one simple project is commited, it is not realistic for some
bigger ones (example: GameEngine), but most wont be that size.

#### Currently built:

1. Simple sdl2 starter project
2. Simpe cellular automata engine done in sdl2
3. Basic CLI tool with programs running on it (cat, touch, batch etc.)
4. Huffman and Differential encoding example, sending data between threads for simulation
5. KVM project where "system calls" are implemented for virtual machines where host machine is simulating operating system 
6. Simple shell in Rust


#### Comming soon:

1. Pacman clone with algorithm for player to autoplay
2. Marching squares in rust + glfw
3. Text Editor 

#### Ideas:

1. Build your own-X, more or less building everything from this repo
2. GameEngine with Vulcan
