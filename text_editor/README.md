As menitioned in the first line this is a project follwing a blog post from flenker on how to make Vim-like text editor from scratch using Rust.

Somehow this project really grew big and will take multiple days to finish, it is a great learning experience and i highly recommend following his blog post isntead of trying to figure things out from my repo.

In the end final projects will be similar but I am more lazy and quality of this tutorial is unreal.

Current state: 

day 1: Caret movement + welcome message
day 2: Truncate lines + resizing

Bugs: 
1. ghost image of auto resizing before applying propper view
