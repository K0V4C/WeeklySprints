## Text Editor (name work in progress)

As menitioned in the credits this is a project follwing a blog post from flenker on how to make Vim-like text editor from scratch using Rust.

Somehow this project really grew big and will take multiple days to finish, it is a great learning experience and i highly recommend following his blog post isntead of trying to figure things out from my repo.

In the end final projects will be similar but I am more lazy and quality of this tutorial is unreal.

### Current state: 

#### Day:
1. Caret movement + welcome message
2. Truncate lines + resizing
2. Better error handling
3. scrolling
3. complex caret movement
4. text viewer almost done weird bug with cluster emojies
5. adding deletion and insertion of characters (backspace and delete work)

#### Bugs: 
- ghost image of auto resizing before applying propper view
- random crash when resizing
- pressing RIGHT goes twice FIXED
- emoji scrolling still doesnt work as it should
- weird bug when going full screen, somehow related to cluster emojies
